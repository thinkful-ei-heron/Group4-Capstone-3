## Introduction

This application is meant to be used in conjunction with the server located at: https://github.com/thinkful-ei-heron/Group4-Capstone3-API.

DearBeer is a platform for keeping track of the beers you have drank, if you liked them, their details, and where you were located when you tried it. One the user has started to build their list of beers, the app will then provide the user with their detailed list, and provide the user the ability to sort, filter, or search all the beers they have tried, as well as provide a visual map of exactly where they have tasted all the hoppy goodness.
