## Introduction

DearBeer is a user friendly appication platform to keep track of different kinds of beers. The user may add details such as a beer rating, details, and location of where beer was tasted.  Once the user has started to build their list of beers, the app will provide the user with a detailed list where the user can sort, filter, and search all the beers they currently have stored.  It also provides the user with a visual map of exactly where they have tasted all the hoppy goodness.
